   but if we do see or someone alerts us that you have posted something that we think is inappropriate then we are allowed at our
   discretion to remove it.
  block3:  |

   any time, you can do either via the payment settings option under your profile or by contacting your mobile service provider. If your chosen payment method is via
   your mobile service provider, then please check with them about their payment terms, as their payment terms will govern how payments to Funglobe are made as well as
   how such payments may be changed or cancelled. Your subscription to Funglobe’s premium services will automatically renew until you decide to cancel, and if you have
   enabled the Auto Top-up feature, your account will automatically be topped up until you decide to disable this feature.

  block48:  |
   Unfortunately we can’t guarantee that because sometimes we have to carry out maintenance to the app or site or they may be affected by a fault or circumstances which
   are outside our control, so Funglobe is provided on an “as is” “as available” basis. No warranty is given about the quality, accuracy, functionality, availability or
   performance of Funglobe and we reserve the right to suspend, withdraw, amend, modify or vary the service provided on Funglobe without notice and without incurring any liability to you.

   you may incur charges from your internet or mobile service provider. We shall not under any circumstances be liable for such charges.
  title22: I’m not registered and I can’t seem to access some Content or features on the app or site. Why is that?
  block51:  |
   Non-registered users are able to access only that portion of Funglobe that is publicly available. They will not have a Profile but may have limited ability to upload
   any Content. The extent of registered users’ access to Funglobe will depend on certain criteria relating to their Profile being met. We may change or update the criteria
   from time to time without prior notice and at our discretion.
  title23: 5. Lookalikes
  title24: How does Lookalikes work?
  block52:  |
   Lookalikes is one feature of the site which is primarily designed to allow you to find people who look similar to celebrities, friends or even you! The feature
   will return photos of people who look like the person you searched for and who are existing members of Funglobe. After using the feature you will be invited to create a
   Funglobe account so that you can contact these “lookalikes” and possibly meet (only if they agree of course!).
  block54: If you do use Lookalikes to upload a photo, please remember to remind yourself of our rules on what Content you may upload.
  title25: What about other people’s rights when I upload a photo?
  block55:  |
   We respect other people’s rights, and you should too. We recognise that as well as uploading a photo of yourself to find your lookalike you may wish to upload
   a photo of someone else to find their lookalike. If you do, then you should get their permission before you upload their photo.
  block56:  |
   Equally, you should not infringe someone else’s intellectual property rights. For further details on this, please refer to the
   section “What kind of content can I post or upload on Funglobegive you prior notice or to refund any unused services to?”.
  title26: Who can see the photo that I upload on Lookalikes?

   We are not responsible for, nor do we run these sites, so remember to check their respective privacy policies and terms of use.
  title271: 6. Termination of use by us
  title27: My Profile has disappeared and I can’t log in. What’s going on?
  block58:  |
   Sometimes people forget about the Terms and post Content or act in a way while on Funglobe which is not consistent with the purpose of the app or site. If we think that you
   may be one of those people, then we reserve the right at our sole discretion, at any time and without liability or the need to give you prior notice or to refund any
   unused services to
  block59: 1. suspend or revoke your registration (where applicable) and your right to access and/or use Funglobe or submit any Content to Funglobe; and
  block60: 2.make use of any operational, technological, legal, or other means available to enforce the Terms (including without limitation blocking specific IP addresses).
  block61:  |
   We will try (but we are not obliged) to notify you if your access to Funglobe and/or your Profile is to be or has been suspended or terminated. Where you have acted contrary
   to our Terms, we will keep a record of it and may block future attempts by you to use or access Fungglobe and its features so that we can keep Funglobe a fun place.
  title28: 7. Termination of use by you
  title291: They say that you can have too much of a good thing… what do I do if I want to “unregister” myself from Funglobe?
  block62:  |
   If you have registered on Funglobe, you can terminate your registration at any time by going to the ‘Settings’ control on Funglobe when you are logged in and choosing
   the ‘delete profile’ link. We save your profile information in case you later decide to restore your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary
   reasons and in doing so expect us to maintain their information until they return to Funglobe. You will therefore be able to restore your account and your profile in
   its entirety within 30 days of de-activating it. Once your registration is terminated, we have the right to delete any related Content that you have submitted or uploaded
   on to Funglobe. For further details, please refer to our Privacy Policy.
  block63:  |
   Content that you have uploaded to Funglobe, other than your Profile (such as comments or email messages), may still appear on Funglobe following termination of your registration.
  title29: 8. Abuse/Complaints
